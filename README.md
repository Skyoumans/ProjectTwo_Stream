### About my game

    I was sitting at home sick one evening and I asked my partner to rent a movie from Redbox that had just recently came out. I became frustrated when he responded that this movie wasn't in stock, and since I didn't want to purchase the movie to own (they get so expensive these days...), I was out of luck. Thus the idea for my app. A way for users to rent the movies they want to see but not pay ridiculous prices when they only want to see it once. Stream allows customers to stream movies directly online after paying a rental price, which varies from movie to movie. They can add movies to a wishlist for films they want to view later. The movies themselves have reviews that the user can leave about their thoughts on a particular film.
